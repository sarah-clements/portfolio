Saving to `/Applications` is **not** recommended, do not do this.\n\n### JPEGmini and support for assistive devices\n\nYou may be presented with the following message the first time you run ImageOptim-CLI with the `--jpeg-mini` flag.\n\n> To automate JPEGmini we need to add Terminal.app (or iTerm.app etc) to the 'support for assistive devices' whitelist.\n\nThe JPEGmini OS X Apps don't include a command line API, so a real user is\nsimulated by entering synthetic clicks and keyboard commands instead. This\nrequires your permission and is easily set up in System Preferences as shown by\nthese guides.\n\n+ [Enable access for assistive devices in OS X Yosemite](http://www.klabouch.com/?p=98).\n+ [OS X Mavericks: Enable access for assistive devices and applications](http://support.apple.com/en-us/HT6026)\n\n\n\n\n\n## Usage\n    Usage: imageoptim [options]\n    \n    Options:\n    \n      -d, --directory       directory of images to process\n      -a, --image-alpha     pre-process PNGs with ImageAlpha.app *\n      -j, --jpeg-mini       pre-process JPGs with JPEGmini.app **\n      -m, --min-quality     pngquant min quality parameter\n      -s, --skip-if-larger  pngquant use --skip-if-larger\n      -q, --quit            quit all apps when complete\n      -c, --no-color        disable color output\n      -h, --help            display this usage information\n      -e, --examples        display some example commands and uses\n      -v, --version         display the version number\n      --verbose             display detailed, per-file info on optimizations\n    \n    *  http://pngmini.com\n    ** https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/jpegmini/id498944723\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n## Examples\n### Optimise a directory of images\n\nThis command will optimise all image files in your Awesome project.\n\n    imageoptim --directory ~/Sites/Awesome # [options]\n\n### Optimise a filtered set of images\n\nThis command will optimise just the .jpg files in your Awesome project.\n\n    find ~/Sites/Awesome -name '*.jpg' | imageoptim # [options]\n\n### Passing additional options\n\nThe long format for enabling options is as follows;\n\n    imageoptim --jpeg-mini --image-alpha --quit --no-color --directory path/to/images\n\nThe equivalent of the above in short format is as follows;\n\n    imageoptim -j -a -q -d -c path/to/images\n\n### Adding to git pre-commit hook\n\nAdding the below to **your_project/.git/hooks/pre-commit** will run imageoptim-CLI\neach time you commit new and changed files into your project. Any files which\naren't images will be ignored.\n\n    images=$(git diff --exit-code --cached --name-only --diff-filter=ACM -- '*.png' '*.jpg')\n    $(exit $?) || (echo \"$images\" | imageoptim && git add $images)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Related Projects\n\n\n### Grunt Plugin\n\nThe ImageOptim-CLI [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com) plugin\nis [grunt-imageoptim](https://github.com/JamieMason/grunt-imageoptim).\n\n\n### Comparison of image optimization tools\n\nImageOptim-CLI features in this comparison of the [performance of image optimisation\ntools](http://jamiemason.github.io/ImageOptim-CLI/) alongside Kraken.io, CodeKit,\ngrunt-contrib-imagemin, Smush.it, and TinyPNG.\n\n\n### Article for Smashing Magazine\n\n[How Optimized Are Your Images? Meet ImageOptim-CLI, a Batch Compression\nTool](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2013/12/17/imageoptim-cli-batch-compression-tool/)\n\n\n### Alfred Workflow\n\nThe ImageOptim-CLI Workflow for Alfred app\nis [alfred-image-optim-workflow](https://github.com/ramiroaraujo/alfred-image-optim-workflow)\n\n\n\n\n## FAQs\n\n\n\n\n\n### General\n\n#### Do ImageOptim, ImageAlpha, or JPEGmini come bundled with the ImageOptim-CLI installation?\n\nYou will need to install these applications separately.\n\n#### Do I have to pay to use ImageOptim-CLI?\n\nThe CLI, ImageOptim and ImageAlpha are all free. JPEGmini is a paid-for product but you can use\nImageOptim-CLI and choose not to run JPEGmini.\n\n#### Why are shorthand options supplied in the format `imageoptim -a -j -q` instead of the more common `imageoptim -ajq`?\n\nThis was an early mistake which now needs supporting for backwards compatibility.\n[Issue 21](https://github.com/JamieMason/ImageOptim-CLI/issues/21) is open to add support for\nthe `-ajq` format as well as the current format.\n\n#### The WebP image format looks promising, can you get ImageOptim-CLI to convert images to it?\n\nWebP looks great and may well overtake the formats handled by ImageOptim-CLI, but converting images\nto WebP is outside ImageOptim-CLI's chosen remit.\n\n#### Can you get ImageOptim-CLI to skip images it has already processed, if they haven't changed?\n\nJPEGmini does this today, but for ImageOptim and ImageAlpha I feel a feature like this belongs\nin those applications rather than this automator.\n\n\n\n\n### ImageOptim\n\n\n#### ImageOptim makes the fans on my Mac run at full power.\n\nOptimising images is a pretty intensive process, so instead of optimising one image at a time (which\nwould take forever) — ImageOptim optimises many images at the same time until all of them are done.\n\nA side effect of this is that the fans come on at full power to keep your machine cool while it's\nmaxed out.\n\n\n\n\n\n### ImageAlpha\n\n#### I don't think ImageAlpha is running, I can't see anything.\n\nImageOptim-CLI uses ImageAlpha's internal installation of [pngquant](http://pngquant.org) so it's\nnormal that nothing is shown on screen.\n\nIt's also possible that if you look in the [Activity Monitor](http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5890)\nyou will not see `pngquant` displayed but it _is_ being run. In my experience it's only when you\nrun ImageOptim-CLI on a very large number of PNGs that you have enough time to spot it.\n\n#### Can I configure ImageAlpha's settings using ImageOptim-CLI?\n\nImageOptim-CLI is intended to be a simple, convenient, powerful, general-purpose image optimisation\ntool. If your needs have outgrown ImageOptim-CLI it's better to\nrun [pngquant](http://pngquant.org) separately, passing whatever custom settings you need.\n\n\n\n\n\n### JPEGmini\n\n#### Can I use ImageOptim-CLI with JPEGmini Lite, the free version of JPEGmini?\n\nNot currently, the full version of JPEGmini already has some subtle differences and JPEGmini Lite\ncauses further fragmentation. It is possible but not a priority, as the free version has a limit of\nprocessing 30 images per day anyway.\n\n#### I upgraded from JPEGmini Lite to JPEGmini but ImageOptim-CLI still says JPEGmini is not installed.\n\nPerforming the in-app upgrade leaves the app named as jpegmini-lite, so ImageOptim-CLI can't\ndetermine whether it's the free or full version. It is better to instead buy [the full version of\nJPEGmini](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/jpegmini/id498944723) separately.\n\n#### ImageOptim-CLI says “To automate JPEGmini we need to enable GUI Scripting”, how do I do that?\n\nSee this tutorial on [how to manage Accessibility preferences\nand GUI Scripting](http://www.macosautomation.com/mavericks/guiscripting/index.html). In the case\nof OS X Mavericks, you will want to add the Applications JPEGmini and Terminal (or equivalent such\nas iTerm).\n\n\n\n\n\n### Windows and Linux\n\n#### Can I use ImageOptim-CLI on Windows or Linux?\n\nImageOptim-CLI is responsible for automating 3 OS X applications so is inherently bound to OS X for\nthat reason.\n\n#### Are there any plans for ImageOptim-CLI to support Windows or Linux?\n\nIt would first require ImageOptim, ImageAlpha, and JPEGmini to be available for those platforms.\n\n#### I don't have OS X, can you recommend an alternative to ImageOptim-CLI?\n\n[@addyosmani](https://github.com/addyosmani) wrote a really thorough article on [tools for\nimage optimization](http://addyosmani.com/blog/image-optimization-tools/) which discusses a wide\nrange of options in great detail.\n",
